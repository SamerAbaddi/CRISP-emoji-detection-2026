# CRISP-emoji-detection-2026

One repo, three artifacts:
(i) A curated, de-identified sample of 100 social-media screenshots (content blurred; emojis, timestamps, and non-identifying UI chrome preserved where possible).
(ii) A structured Excel codebook describing each item (platform, emoji/hybrid patterns, numeronyms, intent labels, etc.).
(iii) A short explainer video (AI-generated) that illustrates the phenomenon of covert/emoji-coded hostility and how our pipeline flags it.

ðŸ”Ž Overview
This repository accompanies the manuscript on adolescent-coded communication and covert hostility. It publishes a reproducible sample (n=100) drawn proportionally from our full Phase-I corpus (N=5,000). The media are youth-dense, public posts/comments where the original textual content is blurred to protect identity and context; we retain only emojis, numeronyms (e.g., 101/404), visible timestamps, and non-identifying layout cues that are necessary for research on semiotic patterns.

**Platforms** (proportional to the full corpus):
YouTube â‰ˆ 30, TikTok â‰ˆ 21, Instagram â‰ˆ 20, Snapchat â‰ˆ 18, Facebook â‰ˆ 11 (total = 100).
**Focus**: emoji clusters, hybrid emoji+alphanumeric patterns, numeronyms (101/404/808/â€¦), and obfuscation cues (e.g., mixed-script/homoglyphs).
**Purpose**: Shared as an educational, research, and benchmarking sample for non-commercial analyses of covert bullying and semiotic moderation.

We do not endorse, normalize, or encourage bullying; the dataset exists to study detection and mitigation, not to replicate harm

**FAQ**
(i) Why blur the text? To remove any possibility of quoting, search-back, or direct identification while preserving emoji order, numeronyms, and layout cues necessary for semiotic analysis.
(ii) Can I get unblurred media? No. This is a research-only sample with strict de-identification.
